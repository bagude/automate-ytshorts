# Task Initiation Workflow Guide

**Purpose:** This guide provides a structured workflow for initiating new tasks, combining all task initiation analysis prompts into a cohesive process.

## Phase 1: Initial Analysis (Requirements & Impact)

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis

Use `01_requirements_analysis.md` to:

- [ ] Define functional requirements
- [ ] Specify non-functional requirements
- [ ] Document constraints
- [ ] Set acceptance criteria
- [ ] Identify initial risks

### Step 2: Impact Analysis

Use `02_impact_analysis.md` to:

- [ ] Assess code impact
- [ ] Evaluate system impact
- [ ] Consider operational impact
- [ ] Analyze business impact
- [ ] Review resource impact

## Phase 2: Planning & Dependencies

### Step 3: Resource Planning

Use `03_resource_planning.md` to:

- [ ] Plan team resources
- [ ] Identify technical resources
- [ ] List external resources
- [ ] Prepare documentation needs
- [ ] Create timeline & budget

### Step 4: Dependency Mapping

Use `04_dependency_mapping.md` to:

- [ ] Map code dependencies
- [ ] Document system dependencies
- [ ] List process dependencies
- [ ] Identify team dependencies
- [ ] Plan dependency management

## Phase 3: Success Definition

### Step 5: Success Criteria

Use `05_success_criteria.md` to:

- [ ] Define functional success metrics
- [ ] Set technical success criteria
- [ ] Establish user success measures
- [ ] Document business success factors
- [ ] Plan success verification

## Workflow Integration

### Pre-Task Checklist:

1. **Gather Information**

   - [ ] Business requirements
   - [ ] Technical context
   - [ ] Resource availability
   - [ ] Timeline constraints
   - [ ] Budget limitations

2. **Stakeholder Alignment**
   - [ ] Identify stakeholders
   - [ ] Get initial input
   - [ ] Set expectations
   - [ ] Define communication plan
   - [ ] Establish review points

### Task Analysis Flow:

1. **Requirements Phase**

   - Start with requirements analysis
   - Document all requirements clearly
   - Get stakeholder sign-off
   - → Leads to impact analysis

2. **Impact Assessment**

   - Review all impact areas
   - Document concerns
   - Plan mitigations
   - → Leads to resource planning

3. **Resource Planning**

   - Based on requirements and impact
   - Consider all resource types
   - Plan for contingencies
   - → Leads to dependency mapping

4. **Dependency Review**

   - Map all dependencies
   - Identify critical paths
   - Plan dependency management
   - → Leads to success criteria

5. **Success Definition**
   - Define clear success metrics
   - Get stakeholder agreement
   - Plan verification methods
   - → Ready for execution

### Task Readiness Checklist:

- [ ] All analyses completed
- [ ] Resources secured
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Success criteria defined
- [ ] Stakeholders aligned
- [ ] Risks identified
- [ ] Mitigations planned
- [ ] Timeline agreed
- [ ] Budget approved
- [ ] Team ready

## Using This Workflow

1. **Start Early**

   - Begin analysis as soon as task is identified
   - Allow time for thorough review
   - Get early stakeholder input
   - Identify blockers quickly

2. **Be Thorough**

   - Complete all sections
   - Document assumptions
   - Note uncertainties
   - Plan for risks

3. **Stay Flexible**

   - Adapt to new information
   - Update as needed
   - Keep stakeholders informed
   - Adjust plans accordingly

4. **Track Progress**
   - Monitor completion of each phase
   - Document decisions
   - Keep analysis updated
   - Share status regularly

This workflow ensures comprehensive task initiation by combining all analysis aspects into a structured process.
